# 20230724 Turning Visual Studio Code into a personal knowledge management platform

- Give the presentation within VSCode using markdown preview

## Introduce the problem
- Personal knowledge moving from connected wiki (eNett Confluence) to distributed, disconnected documents
- Discoverability and rediscoverability of information is difficult

## Brief overview of the Zettelkasten method
What is it - A method of knowledge management that uses a collection of notes that are connected to each other in a non-hierarchical manner (thanks Github Copilot!)
What's a Zettel - A note in the Zettelkasten system
How does it work compared to a heirarchical system - Notes are connected to each other by links, rather than being organised into a hierarchy
How do you find things - Links between notes are created as you write, and you can use the links to navigate between notes

## Introduce Foam

## Walk through modified version of my own repo removing any potentially sensitive content

## Additional useful extensions
- Spellcheck extension is available but I ended up removing it - found maintaining a dictionary an annoying overhead when dealing with shorthand, abbreviation, and domain-specific terms that won't exist in a standard dictionary
- Gitdoc - auto-commit
- Mermaid/Draw.io - diagrams as code
- Markdown All in One - Lots of nice Markdown quality-of-life features
- markdown-formula - Excel-like formulas in Markdown tables
- Paste Image - paste images from clipboard directly into Markdown
- Auto-Open Markdown Preview - if you're working often with templates that don't work well as a raw .md file, can be a bit janky
- Github Copilot - can be surprisingly good at helping to write plain text, but occasionally gives you complete nonsense
