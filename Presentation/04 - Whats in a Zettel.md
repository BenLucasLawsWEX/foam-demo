# 04 - What's in a Zettel?


- Unique identifier (title, maybe ID)
- Body - thoughts, rephrased from original. May contain links to other Zettels.
- Tags - used to relate notes that do not directly reference each other, like #slide
- Links (internal) - provide with context - not just the raw link
- References (external) - not required if it's your own thought and there is no external reference

Example:
> # 20230613 Zettels
> Zettels are the smallest unit of knowledge in a Zettelkasten. They should encapsulate a thought and should have relationships with other Zettels where it makes sense, through tags, direct links, or both.
> The amount of information contained in a Zettel can vary - a single "thought" does not necessarily mean a single sentence or paragraph.
