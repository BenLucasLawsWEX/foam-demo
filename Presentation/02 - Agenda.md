# 02 - Agenda

## The Zettelkasten method
- What it is
- What makes it different
- How you can employ it in your day-to-day work

## Using Visual Studio Code as a note taking tool
- Walkthrough of my note-taking workspace
- Templating common note types
- Useful optional extensions

## Caveats
Take from this presentation what works for you. You can use the method with different tools, and you can use the tools with a different method. The important thing is to find a system that works for you, and this is what works for me.

This repo closely mimics the actual setup I use (except these slides), but it's not my real notes workspace. That has notes on conversations had in confidence, so I can't in good faith share it.

Am I advocating for Visual Studio Code as a presentation platform? Absolutely not, I just thought it would be fun and a good way to work examples into the presentation itself.
