| [markdown-formula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cescript.markdown-formula)                       | Excel-like formulas in Markdown tables.                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [TODO.md Kanban Board](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coddx.coddx-alpha)                           | Turns your TODO.md into a Kanban board, lots of alternatives but I like this one.                                                                                                                                     |
| [Auto-Open Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hnw.vscode-auto-open-markdown-preview) | Automatically open a preview to the side. Can be a bit janky if you're rapidly opening files. I had it turned off for this presentation because it doesn't play nice when you want to navigate through previews only. |

Can be surprisingly good at helping to write plain text, but occasionally gives you complete nonsense.                                                                                   |

| WYSIWYG Markdown editors                                                                                                | Lots of options out there, I prefer to write my notes in raw Markdown.                                                                                                                                                |
