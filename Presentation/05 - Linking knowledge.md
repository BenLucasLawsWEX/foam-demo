# 05 - Linking Knowledge

- In general, tag rather than categorize (folders)
- When I categorize, it's generally based on note type rather than content
- What do I need to know vs what do I need to do

- Core note types
  - Temporary inbox - unstructured brain dump
  - Zettels - stuctured notes

Thought --> Inbox --> Zettel
```

- Times I do categorize thoughts into folders or specific files (in addition to tags)
  - Daily journal - time tracking and daily inbox, basically my "home" note
  - 1:1 meeting notes
  - Quarterly reviews
  - Tickets
  - A to-do list, for when a thought is just a single action I need to do
  - A to-do archive document, for stuff more than a quarter old - effectively my brag doc
